# fatwatch
A repository to contain CAST watch work. Consists of two branches:

master - The current release candidate. Should be tagged with a release number
dev - Work in progress. Likely to be buggy, half-baked and held together with spit and string. Pull at your own risk. 

## Setting up Android Studio, to run the app in an emulator:
 - Go to [developer.android.com](developer.adroid.com/sdk/index.html) and download the software. It's 1.1GB - I suggest using this step to go have lunch.
